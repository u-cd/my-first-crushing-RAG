fine tuning vs RAG
    RAG may better

process
    1. Indexing
        load documents
        Document Loader or Text Chunker
        Embedding Model
        vector store
    2. Retrieval (Search)
        user submits a query
        system serches the most relevant document from vectors
    3. Generation
        retrieved document are inserted into the original user query "augmented prompt"

Key benefits
    Ruduced hallucinations
    Access to current data
    Increased trust and transparency
    Lower costs (compared to fine-tuning or retraining)
    Enhanced customization
